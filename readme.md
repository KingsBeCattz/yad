# YAD File Format

**YAD** is a lightweight binary file format designed for efficient data storage and inspired by the simplicity of **JSON** and the structure of **BSON**.  
Its goal is to provide a compact, tokenized, and easy-to-parse format while keeping the implementation minimal and human-readable through hex dumps.

---

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

- **Lightweight and compact**  
  Stores data in binary form, making it significantly smaller than JSON text representations.

- **Tokenized structure**  
  Each value begins with a type token, making parsing fast and predictable without the need for complex text parsing.

- **Rich numeric support**  
  Distinguishes between signed, unsigned, and floating-point numbers across multiple sizes, from **8 bits up to 64 bits**.

- **Minimalist compared to BSON**  
  Avoids rarely used types like `null`, `date`, `regex`, or `ObjectId`, focusing only on core data types.

- **Flexible string and array lengths**  
  Each string or array can explicitly declare its length (8, 16, 32, or 64 bits), reducing overhead for small values and allowing large ones when needed.

- **Hex-dump friendly**  
  Unlike JSON, YAD is designed to be **readable and understandable** when inspected with a hex editor or dumper.

## üìå Use Cases

- Custom databases or storage engines.
- High-performance applications where JSON is too verbose and BSON is too heavy.
- Scenarios where deterministic, low-level parsing is required.
- Lightweight serialization for embedded systems.

---

## üöÄ Roadmap

- [ ] Reference parser/serializer implementation.
- [ ] Example comparisons with JSON and BSON (size and performance).
- [ ] Tooling for easier inspection and conversion.

## üìö Definitions
YAD uses a system where each byte indicates one thing in the most optimized way. Below, I will explain the types and how they are handled.

### ‚ùó Important headers
YAD uses **special** binary values to mark the beginning or end of a structure like a ‚Äúrow‚Äù or a ‚Äúkey.‚Äù
```md
0xF0 => Version of YAD file, the next four uint8 indicate major, minor, and patch version, followed by a beta flag
0xF1 => Start of a "row"
0xF2 => End of a "row"
0xF3 => Start of a "key"
0xF4 => End of a "key"
```

### üìè Length indicators
YAD uses 8 bits (1 byte) to indicate the length for each value. The prefix byte also encodes the type of the value.
```
0xX1 => Indicates an 8-bit length
0xX2 => Indicates an 16-bit length
0xX3 => Indicates an 32-bit length
0xX4 => Indicates an 64-bit length
```

### üîç Types
YAD uses 4 bits in the prefix byte to indicate the type. The existing types are shown below.

#### üî¢ Numbers
In YAD a number is represented like this:
```md
0x11 0x11
```
That means "Unsigned integer of 8 bits" wich value is 0x11 (17)
Following this, exists 3 types of numbers:
```md
0x1X => Unsigned integer (uin8, uint16, etc.) 
0x2X => Signed integer 
0x3X => Floating point number 
```
> Note: The numbers are in big-endian format
#### ‚úè Strings
In YAD, a string is represented like this:
```md
0x41 0x04 0x6E 0x61 0x6D 0x65
```
That means "A string wich length is less of u8, his length is of 0x04 Bytes", the next bytes is the text in UTF-8, in this case, is "name"
#### ‚ùì Booleans
YAD represents booleans like this:
```md
0x80 => False
0x81 => True
```
Any value equal or greater than 0x81 is considerated as `True`
#### üìÉ Arrays
YAD represents arrays like this:
```md
0x51 0x01 0x41 0x04 0x6E 0x61 0x6D 0x65
```
That means: "An array with length is less of u8, his length is of one who is a String ..."
#### üè∑ Keys names and Rows names
These works same as Strings but they are only used for his context, on keys and rows
